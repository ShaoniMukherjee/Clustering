# Clustering
Creating clusters on the basis of K-means clustering algorithm in Python. 
There are two steps in Kmeans algorithm and they are assignment and optimisation.
In the first step that is the assignment step clusters centers are assigned and the distance between each data point to the clusters centers are calculated using euclidean distance. 
Next the mean of the datapoint belonging to each clusters is taken and this point is assigned as the new cluster centroid which is the assignment step. This process is iterated until it reaches the converges that is the algorithm finds the best clusters.

Now, Kmeans ++ algorithm is the cluster initialisation procedure for k means clustering
To find the optimum number of clusters silhouette analysis/score and elbow curve is used.
Further to find if the data is suitable for clustering can be found using Hopkins Statistics.
