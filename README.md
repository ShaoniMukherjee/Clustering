# Clustering
Creating clusters on the basis of K-means clustering algorithm in Python. 
There are two steps in Kmeans algorithm and they are assignment and optimisation.
In the first step that is the assignment step clusters centers are assigned and the distance between each data point to the clusters centers are calculated using euclidean distance. 
Next the mean of the datapoint belonging to each clusters is taken and this point is assigned as the new cluster centroid which is the assignment step. This process is iterated until it reaches the converges that is the algorithm finds the best clusters.

Now, Kmeans ++ algorithm is the cluster initialisation procedure for k means clustering
To find the optimum number of clusters silhouette analysis/score and elbow curve is used.
Further to find if the data is suitable for clustering can be found using Hopkins Statistics.

Overview
Online retail is a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail. The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.

The steps are broadly:

Read and understand the data
Clean the data
Prepare the data for modelling
